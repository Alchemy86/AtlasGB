"""Regenerate the derived columns of the atlas.

`data/atlas.tsv` is the single source of truth for where Pokemon Red and Blue
keep everything.  Eight of its ten columns are *derived* from a built
`pret/pokered` checkout, and two are *ours*: what the entry is, in our own
words, and how it was verified.  This script rewrites the derived columns and
leaves ours alone, so a pokered bump is a reviewable diff rather than a rewrite.

    tools/extract.py --pokered /path/to/pokered            # report drift
    tools/extract.py --pokered /path/to/pokered --write    # apply it

The checkout must have been *built* (`make blue`, RGBDS 1.0.3) so that
`pokeblue.map` exists and `pokeblue.gbc` matches `roms.sha1`; this script checks
the ROM's SHA-1 before it will believe a single address.  Nothing from pokered
is vendored here and nothing is fetched at run time: you point it at your own
checkout or you do not run it.

Only symbol names, addresses and structure are taken — those are facts about
the cartridge.  pokered's prose and comments are not ours to copy, so every
`desc` in the atlas is written from scratch, and every claim is checked against
a running cartridge by an emulator; see `docs/verification.md`.

**The file it writes starts with its header row and carries no comment lines.**
That is deliberate: GitHub's TSV viewer has no notion of a comment, and a
preamble costs the file its rendered, sortable, searchable table view.  The
provenance those six lines used to carry lives in `docs/provenance.md`.

    * `gap` — bytes inside a section that no label reaches.  There is exactly one
      in WRAM and it is not an oversight: the *Stack* section is $DF00-$DFFF and
      its only label, `wStack`, sits at $DFFF, because the stack pointer starts
      at the top and grows downwards through the whole 256 bytes.
    * `free` — a run the linker reported as EMPTY, i.e. RAM the game declares no
      storage for at all.

    something the atlas states rather than something a reader has to infer from
